# SiEDA — notes for Claude Code

- Core (C++): `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j && ./build/sieda_core_tests`
- macOS app: `./run.sh` (builds the core, generates the Xcode project, runs the app).
- Footprint Editor: core in `Core/src/CustomParts.cpp` (`landPatternFromFootprint`, `checkLandPattern`), app in
  `SiEDA/Models/FootprintDraft.swift` and `SiEDA/Views/Library/FootprintEditorView.swift`; guide in
  `docs/FOOTPRINT_EDITOR.md`. Keep the Swift `CustomPartSpec.Land` encoding identical to the core's land JSON.
- Library parts live in `Core/src/StandardParts.cpp`; KiCad-derived pinouts are generated into
  `Core/src/StandardCatalog.inc` by `tools/fetch_catalog_parts.py` — don't edit that file by hand.

## Missing IC parts

Fourteen catalog parts still need their pinouts from the vendor datasheet. The list, one file per part, and the
step-by-step procedure (fill the pin table, add a `catalog(...)` entry, update the tests) are in
[`docs/missing-parts/README.md`](docs/missing-parts/README.md). When asked to add or update missing parts, follow that
file and keep each part's Status line current.
